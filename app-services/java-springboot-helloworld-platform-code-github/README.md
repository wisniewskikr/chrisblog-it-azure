DESCRIPTION
-----------

##### Goal
The goal of this project is to present how to work with **Microsoft Azure App Services** using **Azure Platform**. 

Azure Platform is web console for Azure Resources. Using this console user can work with Azure Resources via browser.

Azure App Service enables to deploy web application in Azure Cloud. 

This project presents:
* How to create Azure App Service type **code** for **Java** Runtime stack. Code means that pure package is used for deployment - for instance for Java it's "jar" file. 
* How to deploy **Java Spring Boot** application using **Azure App Services Deployment Center** from **Github** repository. Code from Github is deployed in Azure by **Github Actions** which are automatically created and deployed on Github during this deployment.
